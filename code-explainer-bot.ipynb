    "\n",
    "* **Model limitations and switching:** During testing, I noticed that the initially used model eventually failed to respond. Switching to another model, or using retry logic, ensured continuity and better-quality explanations. It reinforced the need to consider model choice, reliability, and fallback strategies when building interactive AI tools.\n",

      "Let's break down this `ModuleNotFoundError`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What the Error Means**\n",
      "\n",
      "This error, `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'some_nonexistent_module'`, is Python's way of telling you that it couldn't find the specific piece of code (the module) you're trying to bring into your current program. Think of modules as pre-written toolkits or libraries that provide extra functions and capabilities. When you use the `import` statement, you're asking Python to load one of these toolkits so you can use its tools. This error means Python looked for the toolkit you named, but it just wasn't where it expected to find it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why It Happened**\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common reason for this error is that the module you're trying to import simply isn't installed in your current Python environment. Python only comes with a core set of built-in modules. For most other functionalities (like handling web requests, working with specific data formats, or creating advanced visualizations), you need to install external libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another possibility, though less likely if you're sure the module exists, is that there might be a typo in the module's name. Python is case-sensitive, so `Some_Module` is different from `some_module`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, if the module is installed but in a location that Python isn't currently checking, you could also see this error. This is more common in complex setups with multiple Python installations or virtual environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to Fix It Conceptually**\n",
      "\n",
      "To resolve this, you need to make the module accessible to your Python interpreter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary way to do this is by **installing the module**. Python has a package manager called `pip` that is designed specifically for this purpose. You would use `pip` to download and install the module from an online repository. Once installed, Python will be able to locate and import it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you suspect a typo, you'll need to **verify the correct spelling** of the module you intend to import. Check the documentation or source where you learned about this module to ensure you're using the exact name.\n",
      "\n",
      "In scenarios with multiple Python installations, you might need to ensure you are using `pip` that corresponds to the Python interpreter running your code. This often involves using `pip` within a specific virtual environment or using a command like `python -m pip install ...` to explicitly tie the installation to the correct Python executable.\n",

      "--- Explanation (developer) ---\n",
      "This error, `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero`, is quite literal in its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "It occurred because your code attempted to perform a division operation where the divisor was zero. In mathematics, division by zero is undefined, and Python, like most programming languages, will halt execution and raise this specific error to prevent an unresolvable operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To fix this conceptually, you need to ensure that the number you are dividing by is never zero. This might involve adding checks before the division occurs. You could, for instance, examine the value of the divisor to see if it's zero. If it is, you'll need to decide on an alternative course of action, such as skipping the division, providing a default value, or signaling an error condition to the user or another part of your program.\n"
